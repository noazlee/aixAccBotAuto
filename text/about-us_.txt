AIX BRAND STORY
AIX BRAND STORY
The parent company of AI X Academy, GradientX, first began exclusively as an AI consulting and implementation organization. Along the company’s journey, requests for AI training and upskilling surged due to the value of successful AI implementations in various industries today, examples include ChatGPT and Sora. AI implementation has also been accelerated on account of advancements of processing speed, cloud computing and affordable storage.
Amidst the growing prominence of AI, one of the founders of the academy, Peter Kua,  once grappled with doubts similar to many aspiring trainees. Now, we’re here to empower individuals from various types of backgrounds to discover their potential in practical AI and excel in the dynamic field. Thus, an academy of in-house courses headed by HRDC certified trainers was created.
AI X Academy is a representation and embodiment of the next step in GradientX’s roadmap – upskilling individuals in the latest AI trends such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI. Our main commitment is to upskill individuals in practical AI as well as become an established regional leader in AI thought. Our courses are anchored to real-life business cases and curated by industry experts. A hands-on experience and opportunities to network with industrial partners are both components of the accelerated learning journey AI X Academy will provide you with to build practical AI solutions and propel a career in technology forward.

Graduate Testimonials
Noah Lee,
our newest AIX Academy Graduate
I am really glad I did the course as it introduced me to the basics of AI and how to use LLMs in practical settings. I was able to test out my own chat bot using new techniques and am able to follow new developments in AI a lot more clearly after the bootcamp. It was also a cool and a low time commitment. Considering the emphasis so many businesses are placing in AI and LLMs, I would definitely recommend taking the bootcamp.
Jeyshalini Tevosha,
